                    two were done as school projects, the final one as a small business venture I have started.

                <p>A CSS Zen Garden project done by me and my classmate, Lisa. We split tasks between each other. My 
                    contributions included the swaying moon, glow effects, and the font, color, and layout choices.

                <p>A website made for a fictional business for a school project. There are multiple working pages, 
                    API integration, and a form that will track across multiple visits of the site.

                <p>A personal project. While made with Squarespace, this site shows the power of website editors. 
                    This page was designed by me to be as user-friendly as possible, and will hopefully scale with more 
                    businessses that advertise with the Boise Business Board.
